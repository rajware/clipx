This repository contains the source code for ClipX, a cross-platform clipboard manager. The application is written in C# and uses the .NET 8.0 framework.

This application is the demo part of a session that demonstrates the principles of cross-platform app development, from the perspectives of design, development, testing and distribution. 

## ClipX features:

  * Copying text read from stdin to the clipboard
  * Pasting text read from the clipboard to stdout
  * Saving text read from the clipboard to a named file
  * Maintaining a round-robin history of clipboard contents
